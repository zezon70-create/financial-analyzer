Financial Analyzer — Quick Audit & Fix Report
Generated: 2025-10-07 06:35 UTC

Summary of automated checks & fixes applied:
- Unzipped project and scanned 40 files.
- Fixed missing local asset references in: comparisons.html, settings.html, report.html.
  - style.css paths updated to css/style.css
  - reports.html references corrected to report.html
  - logo.png references updated to assets/logo.png
- Replaced intrusive `alert(...)` calls with `showToast(...,'error')` in JS files:
  - js/fa_csv_import.js, js/fa_enhancements.js, js/fa_excel_export.js
- Patched i18n loading path in js/fa_enhancements.js: now loads `lang/<lang>.json` (was `i18n/`).
- Verified existence of CSS assets: css/style.css, css/fa_enhancements.css and assets/logo.png.
- Ensured no missing local references remain in HTML files (static check).
- Located unit tests at tests/unit-tests.html (manual run recommended in browser).

Files scanned: 18 top-level files
Important scripts inspected: js/fa_enhancements.js, js/fa_csv_import.js, js/fa_excel_export.js, js/input.js, js/advanced.js, js/fa_enhancements.js

Recommended manual runtime checks (must be run in a browser):
1. Open tests/unit-tests.html and click 'Run Tests' — record results (some tests may rely on browser APIs).
2. Upload several sample CSV/XLSX (Arabic + English) via upload.html and verify parsing, encoding (UTF-8), and table generation.
3. Generate PDF from report.html (Export to PDF) and verify headers/footers, logo, watermark, and page breaks for A4/Letter.
4. Use large dataset to test performance (thousands of rows) and observe memory/CPU; consider Web Workers for heavy computation.
5. Test i18n toggle (AR/EN) and ensure all strings localize.
6. Test all interactive buttons across pages (dashboard, compare, advanced, settings) to confirm no runtime JS errors in console.

Next development priorities to reach "world-class":
- Add user accounts & project save/load (local or cloud) for session persistence.
- Provide direct integrations with popular accounting APIs (QuickBooks, Xero), or at minimum CSV templates and importer profiles.
- Implement Web Workers / streaming parsing for very large files.
- Improve visual polish: responsive design, accessibility (a11y), keyboard navigation, color-contrast, and RTL fixes.
- Add automated CI testing (GitHub Actions) and ESLint + Prettier formatting rules.
- Add security review (XSS, file upload validation).
